iConomy Reloaded
=======

Original, almost untouched iConomy forked from iConomy 6.0.10b
contains various bugfixes (namely the flatfile bug has been fixed), 
updates and improvements to fit latest coding standards.

If anyone is interested of updating to support UUIDs, feel free to fork, 
but please make a migration as well so old holdings will be preserved. 

Fully back-compatible with iConomy 6.0.10b.

*For quick download grab the iConomy.jar from precompiled folder!*
